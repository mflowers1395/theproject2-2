  <h1> My Personal Opinion </h1>

  <p> Honestly, I love black tea with honey and lemon because it's such a calming and nutirrious beverage. </p>

  <p> I love to drink it while reading, knitting, or sitting outside. </p>

  <p> Before honey, I was putting two full teaspoons of sugar in my tea everymorning. As a result, I felt drained. </p>

  <p> Switching to Honey was the best deicison in my life. Not only does my tea stay sweet, but I am getting benefits I need early in the morning </p>

  <p> DISCLAIMER: Honey STILL has sugar in it, but it is a healther alternative to sugar. It doesn't spike up your blood sugar levels quickly like pure white suagr does </p>
